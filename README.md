## Vision Statement

### Title

Time Since

### Summary

An app to remind the user when they last did something.

### Detail

It's a centralized app for keeping track of user defined events so that the
user doesn't have to remember everything.

The features that this app will contain:

- You can add events from a preset list or create your own.
- You can add or edit how often you want the event to remind you.
  - (or get reminder to do it, or that you did not do it)
- You can categorize events.
  - The ability to add labels and mark events as favourites.
    - Can add your own custom labels, or pick from a list.
  - The ability to sort and view those categories.
- You can set a one time alarm to remind you to do something.
  - (recurring alarm would be an event)

#### Categories

- Reminder
- Self-help
- Tracker

#### Users

This app would be extremely useful for people with:

- ADHD
- Dementia
- People who want to be reminded of the  last time that they did something, like:
    - bought a toothbrush
    - watered your plants
    - cleaned a filter
    - cleaned the floor
    - exercised
- Addicts:
    - who want to know the last time that they partook in their drug of choice,
      like the last time they had a cigarette.

#### Why the project is valuable

People forget things.  Our memories aren't perfect.
The other apps on the market don't have the same functionality.

#### Success Criteria

We'll consider this app a success if we have:

- User rating of 4+.
- Users don't delete the app for 3+ months.
- 10% increase in active monthly users each month for the first 6 months.
  - (measured by logs from server login / opening the app)

---

NOTE:

  - We want the app to be intuitive and easy enough to use that you'd want to
    use it and choose it over another app, or physical paper.
    - Not sure how we'd measure this, but it sounds like it'd fit under the
      Success Criteria field.
